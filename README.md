These are four small apps written in Kotlin language for Android.

#### Complex Number Calculator 
The first app is a simple complex number calculator. User can input separately the real part and imaginary part of each number, then choose either addition or substraction from a Spinner (drop-down list box). The result is being displayed on the Gaussian plane.

#### Ball Game
The second one is a game in which user decides about the direction of movement of a ball by tilting the phone. The program implements Newton's third law, so when ball is on one side and user doesn't perform any movement, the ball is bouncing till it stops. OpenGL and accelerometer sensor were used in this application.

#### Santa Claus Card
The third app creates a card to Santa Claus. After pressing button "Add", thanks to Google Now, user can tell the list of gifts he wants to get from Santa, then after pressing "Generate" button he makes a selfie using camera and at the end all of it is merge into a web postcard with user localization.

#### USB Devices
Last application after pressing button "List devices" displays information about each USB device (including device name, product name, VID and PID) connected to host.
